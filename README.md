# NFl Combine and Success Analysis
CSE 163 Final Project
William Dinh & Ian Kraemer

Before we begin, please download the following datasets from Kaggle.

All Time NFL Combine Stats Data
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/savvastj/nfl-combine-data/data 

NFL Career Stats & Total Games:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/loganlauton/nfl-player-data

Once downloaded, unzip the Kaggle csv files, and place them in the same folder/directory as the data_loader.py file and the analysis.py files. 
While in the directory, create your own "pngs" folder, leaving it empty. This will be to access and see all the graphs in png format. 
The "pngs" folder from this repository shows what the graphs should look like. Please reference those if you believe your graphs look off.

Navigate to analysis.py. Make sure you have the following libraries downloaded:
Pandas
Seaborn
MatPlotLib
Numpy
Sklearn

Once all of these are downloaded, you are able to run the code, and the graphs will show up properly in the png folder.
